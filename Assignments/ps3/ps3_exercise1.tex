\noindent\textbf{Problem 1:}\\
\noindent\textbf{(A):} We wish to find the probability that a particular pigeonhole never has a pigeon of 
a certain type. Each pigeon picks a pigeonhole at random and independently from one another, so a 
given hole has a $\frac{1}{n}$ chance of being picked. The chance of a given hole \emph{not} being 
picked, then, is equal to $1-\frac{1}{n}=\frac{n-1}{n}$. The probability then that the $n$ pigeons of a 
particular type never pick the same pigeonhole is
$$(\frac{n-1}{n})^n$$
\noindent\textbf{(B):} We wish to find the expected number of pigeons of a particular type that fly away. 
Let $X_i$ equal 1 if a pigeon flies away from hole $i$, and 0 if otherwise. By linearity of expectation, 
we can say that $X$, the expected number of pigeons of a given type that fly away, is equal to the 
summation over all the values that $X$ can take. From part A, we know that the probability that the $n$ 
pigeons of a particular type never pick the same pigeonhole is $(\frac{n-1}{n})^n$. It is given that there 
are $n$ pigeonholes, so the summation can be given as 
$$X=\sum_{x=1}^{n}(\frac{x-1}{x})^x$$
\noindent\textbf{(C):} We wish to find the expected number of pigeons that fly away. From part B, we 
know that the expected number of pigeons of a particular type that fly away is equivalent to 
$\sum_{x=1}^{n}(\frac{x-1}{x})^x$. It is given that there are $n$ types of pigeons, so this expectation 
needs to be applied to each type of pigeon to find the total expected number of pigeons that fly 
away. If $X$ is defined as the total number of pigeons that fly away, then
$$X=n\cdot\sum_{x=1}^{n}(\frac{x-1}{x})^x$$
