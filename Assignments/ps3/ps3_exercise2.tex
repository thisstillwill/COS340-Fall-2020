\noindent\textbf{Problem 2:}\\
We wish to determine if the variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent.\\\\
We know that two variables are independent if they satisfy
$$P(A\&B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)$$
From the information given, we can find $P(X)$ from the events where $X=1$. This is equal to
$$P(X)=0.32+0.08=0.40$$
Likewise, we can find $P(Y)$ as
$$P(Y)=0.32+0.48=0.80$$
We can then calculate $P(X)\cdot P(Y)$ as
$$P(X)\cdot P(Y)=0.80\cdot0.40=0.32$$
The given value of $P(X\&Y)$ (where both variables are 1) is 0.32, so since\\ $P(X\&Y)=P(X)\cdot P(Y)$ 
we have determined that $X$ and $Y$ are independent.
