\noindent\textbf{Problem 2:}\\
We wish to prove
$$P(n): (1+a)^n\ge1+an$$
where $n\in\N$ and $a\ge-1$ is a real number.\\\\
(Base Case) We first show $P(0)$ is true, i.e. that the formula is valid when
$n=0$. If $n=0$, then
$$(1+a)^0\ge1+a\cdot0$$
$$1\ge1$$
and $P(0)$ holds.\\\\
(Inductive Step) Let $k\ge0$ and suppose that $P(n)$ is true when $n=k$. It now remains to be shown 
following our inductive hypothesis that $P(k+1)$ is true. \\
From the inequality given to us we can write $P(k+1)$ as
$$(1+a)^{k+1}\ge1+a(k+1)$$
$$(1+a)^k\cdot(1+a)^1\ge1+a(k+1)$$
$$(1+a)^k\ge\frac{1+a(k+1)}{(1+a)}$$
Now the right-hand side of the inequality can be simplified as
$$=\frac{1+ak+a}{1+a}$$
$$=\frac{1+a}{1+a}+\frac{ak}{1+a}$$
$$=1+\frac{ak}{1+a}$$
We now have the full inequality written as
$$(1+a)^k\ge1+ak$$
Thus $P(k+1)$ is true. By Weak Induction we have proven that the inequality is valid where 
$n\in\N$ and $a\ge-1$ is a real number.
