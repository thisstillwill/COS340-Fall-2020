\noindent\textbf{Problem 6:}\\
We wish to show that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are conditionally independent given $E_3$ and that
$$Pr[E_1\cap E_2|E_3]=Pr[E_1|E_3]\cdot Pr[E_2|E_3]$$
We first note that 
if $P(A)>0$ we have that $P(B|A)=P(B)$ are independent. We now have that
$$Pr[E_1\cap E_2|E_3]=Pr[E_1]\cdot Pr[E_2]$$
We are given that $E_1$, $E_2$, $E_3$ are mutually independent, so we now have that
$$Pr[E_1\cap E_2]=Pr[E_1]\cdot Pr[E_2]$$
The intersection of two mutually independent events is just their product, so we have that
$$Pr[E_1]\cdot Pr[E_2]=Pr[E_1]\cdot Pr[E_2]$$
We have successfully shown that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are conditionally independent given $E_3$.
